  <h1 style="text-align: center;">FULL STACK WEB DEVELOPMENT TECH STACK </h1>
 <dt>LAMP Stack</dt>
 <dd>A LAMP stack is a bundle of four different software technologies that developers use to build websites and web applications. LAMP is an acronym for the operating system, Linux; the web server, Apache; the database server, MySQL; and the programming language, PHP. All four of these technologies are open source, which means they are community maintained and freely available for anyone to use. Developers use LAMP stacks to create, host, and maintain web content. It is a popular solution that powers many of the websites you commonly use today.</dd>
 <br>
 <dt>MEAN Stack</dt>
 <dd>The MEAN stack is a JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications. MEAN is named after MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node, the four key technologies that make up the layers of the stack.
 <ul>
  <li>MongoDB — document database</li>
  <li>Express(.js) — Node.js web framework</li>
  <li>Angular(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework</li>
  <li>Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server</li>
 </ul>
 </dd>
 <br>
 <dt>MERN Stack</dt>
 <dd>MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.
  <ul>
    <li>MongoDB — document database</li>
    <li>Express(.js) — Node.js web framework</li>
    <li>React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework</li>
    <li>Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server</li>
  </ul>
 </dd>
 <br>
 <dt>.NET Stack</dt>
 <dd>There is a lot that can be done using .NET. However, this versatility can also be overwhelming for inexperienced developers. That’s why many companies are opting to hire full stack .NET developers, as they can manage tasks related to the front-end and back-end of projects. These are very important skills, particularly because of the rise of cloud computing technologies.</dd>
 <br>
 <dt>React native Stack</dt>
 <dd>React Native enables you to render applications natively. In other words, your application will use the same programming platform as a native application, despite not being specially created for that device. React is a JavaScript library. It’s also referred to as ReactJS or React.js.</dd>
